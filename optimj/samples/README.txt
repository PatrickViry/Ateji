.optimj files are OptimJ source files
.java files with the same name are their translation by the OptimJ source-to-source compiler.

This set of sample is designed to work with the LpSolve optimization engine. There are other samples for other optimization engines, but the source code is essentially the same.

lp_solve is a free (see LGPL for the GNU lesser general public license)
linear (integer) programming solver based on the revised simplex method
and the Branch-and-bound method for the integers. lp_solve has its own
community via the Yahoo group http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lp_solve.
There you can find the latest sources, executables for the common
platforms, examples, manuals and a message board where people can share
their thoughts on lp_solve.

The lp_solve Java wrapper is available at
